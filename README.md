# Turtlelib Library
A library for handling transformations in SE(2) and other turtlebot-related math.

# Components
- rigid2d - Handles 2D rigid body transformations
- frame_main - Perform some rigid body computations based on user input

# Conceptual Questions
1. We need to be able to ~normalize~ Vector2D objects (i.e., find the unit vector in the direction of a given Vector2D):
   - Propose three different designs for implementing the ~normalize~ functionality
        1) compute the L2 magnitude of the vector, and divide each element of the vector inside a function
        2) normalize vectors by default during construction, inside contructors
        3) use a c++ linear algebra library, like eigen

   - Discuss the pros and cons of each proposed method, in light of the C++ Core Guidelines.
        1) pro: simple straight forward logic; con: more than one logical operator inside function, a little more costly at runtime per transaction
        2) pro: all vectors are normalized (useful if you will end up normalizing *every* vector anyways). cons: YAGNI - costly if vector normalization isn't used too often, as these operations will happen for every single vector that's initialized
        3) pro: simple implementation, cons: doing #include copies entire library into code, which takes far more memory; also, you're using code that you have not written personally, so there's a greater chance of acccidentally implementing the method incorrectly. 

   - Which of the methods would you implement and why?
        I would use the first method that I described, since it's the most logical (to me), and is optimal if vector normalization occurs, but only infrequently.

2. What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?
     There is no difference between a class and a struct *except* structs have all member variables public by default.


3. Why is Vector2D a struct and Transform2D a Class (refer to at least 2 specific C++ core guidelines in your answer)?
     The primary reason is due to C++ core guideline C.2, which says that since Transform2D has variables that should be private (and thus its class variables should not vary independently), Transform 2D should be a class; on the other hand, since Vector2D can independently vary its x and y, it should be a struct.
     Additionally, the design choice here is to make the member variables of class Transform2D private, so only its own objects can access those variables. As per guideline C.8, a class must be used rather than a struct any time a member is non-public.


4. Why are some of the constructors in Transform2D explicit (refer to a specific C++ core guideline in your answer)?
     As per guideline C.46, single argument constructors should, by default, use the "explicit" keyword to avoid any unintended conversions.


5. Why is Transform2D::inv() declared const while Transform2D::operator*=() is not?
   - Refer to [[https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#con-constants-and-immutability][C++ Core Guidelines (Constants and Immutability)]] in your answer
   By default, member functions in a class should be declared as const. However, since the overloaded Transform2D::operator*=() is modifying the "this" object of the class, the function cannot be declared constant. As per guidleine Con.2, "a member function should be marked const unless it changes the objectâ€™s observable state"; the *= operator is modifying the Transform2D object itself, and so should not be defined as a const function.
